# Sam Randall Consulting
### I help teams use data, software and AI to solve technical challenges.

I have expertise building automated pipelines for data analysis, training and integrating ML models into software, and using mathematical and computational techniques to solve hard problems. I also have experience creating business strategy and can advise business executives on technical matters.

I'm also very interested in mathematical problems (e.g optimization, combinatorics) and system modeling tasks (e.g simulation, graphical modeling, geometric modeling) given my strong interest in Applied Mathematics. I received my Masters from Stanford University in Mathematical and Computational Engineering and find the intersections of applied mathematics with software and ML to be fascinating.

## What I can help you with

### System Design and Implementation
Design and collaborate on full-stack software solutions to meet business opportunities.

### Data Processing / Analysis
Scrape, organize, clean and analyze data for your needs.

Example: In 2018, I scripted data analysis software while working at PHICOR to standardize processes and reduce manual work spent on formatting text and figures. 

### ML / Software Integration

I can train ML models and embed them on edge applications or in the cloud to serve them. My specialty is in iOS but I'm excited about other opportunities.

Work Example: See the iPad App I built for Athena Security in action.
