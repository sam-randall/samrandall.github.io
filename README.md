### Custom Clustering for ML Use Cases
At BluelightAI, I developed algorithms to help data scientists group novel data groups,
find data that's confusing the model, and trace error patterns.
I applied topological concepts to deep learning to do this.


### ML / Software Integration

I custom-build iOS applications with complex hardware and sensor requirements. 

I embed ML models on edge applications (e.g iOS). 

Work Example: See the iPad App I built for Athena Security in action.

### High Performance Computing
I also have a strong background in High Performance Computing (C++, cuda, boost, OpenMP). I've built a physics simulator of a mesh with over 100k nodes as part of a Stanford course in Advanced Software Development. Here's a subset of the code I worked on: <a href="https://github.com/sam-randall/portfolio/blob/main/mesh_graph/Graph.hpp" target="_blank"> Mesh Graph Portfolio.</a>

Additionally, in CUDA and OpenMP, I implemented a multi-machine training algorithm for MNIST in CME 213, a Parallel Computing course at Stanford.

### System Modeling
At PHICOR, I worked to model, understand & quantify how epidemics (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30544164/" target="_blank">Zika</a>,
    <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31104883/" target="_blank">Chagas</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379721000210" target = "blank_">COVID</a>) impact a population. We used SIR and Markov models.

At the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/natural-sciences/about/directory/nathaniel-whitaker" target="_blank"> Whitaker</a> lab in UMASS Amherst, I modeled the dynamics and interactions of leukemia and healthy cells within a 1D vein using partial differential equations.

### Data Processing / Analysis
Scrape, organize, clean and analyze data for your needs.

I scripted data analysis software while working at PHICOR to standardize processes and reduce manual work spent on formatting text and figures. 


## Applications of Interest

#### Real-Time ML / Tiny ML (on IoT) / Robotics
- I'm really interested in working on resource-constrained ML problems. 

#### AI Control
- Hoping to connect with teams who need tight control or explainability over their ML models.

#### Climate Tech & Policy
- Apply data-driven and algorithmic methods to sustainability and climate solutions.

## Research Interests
I am also interested in applying concepts from mathematics (geometry and topology) to invigorate innovations & research in other disciplines:
- Machine Learning (esp. computer vision)
- Computational Theory & algorithms
    - Encryption & Data Compression
    - Graph Flow Algorithms, Causal Modeling.
- Interested in exploring applications in Applied Physics & Computational Biology.
