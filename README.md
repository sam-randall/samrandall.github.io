# Sam Randall

#### Profile
Data & AI Professional with a strong foundation in applied mathematics, computational engineering, and full-stack software development. Skilled at designing and implementing end-to-end data pipelines, integrating machine learning (ML) models (computer vision, natural language, tabular predictive modeling) into production systems, and solving complex optimization problems. Adept at translating technical insights into strategic business recommendations.

#### Core Aim
Understand and solve complex real-world problems to make people's lives better.

#### Education

Stanford University, MS, Computational and Mathematical Engineering.

Johns Hopkins University, BS, Applied Mathematics and Public Health.

## Select Projects & Experiences

### Data Processing / Analysis
Scrape, organize, clean and analyze data for your needs.

I scripted data analysis software while working at PHICOR to standardize processes and reduce manual work spent on formatting text and figures. 

### ML / Software Integration

I can custom-build iOS applications with complex hardware and sensor requirements. 

I can train ML models and embed them on edge applications (e.g iOS)

Work Example: See the iPad App I built for Athena Security in action.

Use this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2YbpxIprDI" target="_blank"> Youtube link</a> to see a functional demo of the iPad app.

### System Modeling
At PHICOR, I worked on a team to model how epidemics (Zika, Chagas) impact a population. We used differential equation (SIR) models.

At the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/natural-sciences/about/directory/nathaniel-whitaker" target="_blank"> Whitaker</a> lab in UMASS Amherst, I modeled the dynamics and interactions of leukemia and healthy cells within a 1D vein using partial differential equations. 

## Interests

#### Applied Topology
- Leveraging topological data analysis and other emerging mathematical tools to build data processing systems.

#### Climate Tech & Policy
- Apply data-driven and algorithmic methods to sustainability and climate solutions.

#### Network Optimization / Discrete Mathematics Algorithms
- Solve combinatorial optimization and integer programming problems (examples include scheduling algorithms, matching algorithms, network optimization, & supply chain optimization).

#### AI Regulation
- Hoping to connect with teams who need tight control over their ML models.
