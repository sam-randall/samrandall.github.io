# Sam Randall Consulting
### I help teams use data, software and AI to solve technical challenges.

#### Profile
Data & AI Consultant with a strong foundation in applied mathematics, computational engineering, and full-stack software development. Skilled at designing and implementing end-to-end data pipelines, integrating ML models (computer vision, natural language, tabular predictive modeling) into production systems, and solving complex optimization problems. Adept at translating technical insights into strategic business recommendations.

I'm also very interested in mathematical problems (e.g optimization, combinatorics) and system modeling tasks (e.g simulation, graphical modeling, geometric modeling) given my strong interest in Applied Mathematics. I received my Masters from Stanford University in Mathematical and Computational Engineering and find the intersections of applied mathematics with software and ML to be fascinating.

## What I can help you with

### System Design and Implementation
Design and collaborate on full-stack software solutions to meet business opportunities.

### Data Processing / Analysis
Scrape, organize, clean and analyze data for your needs.

Example: In 2018, I scripted data analysis software while working at PHICOR to standardize processes and reduce manual work spent on formatting text and figures. 

### ML / Software Integration

I can train ML models and embed them on edge applications or in the cloud to serve them. My specialty is in iOS but I'm excited about other opportunities.

Work Example: See the iPad App I built for Athena Security in action.
