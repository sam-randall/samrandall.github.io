#### Core Aims
Solve complex real-world problems with math, careful algorithm design, computational power and AI.

Technical challenges motivate me, but ultimately my aim is to make the world happier, healthier and safer.

#### Profile
<img src="https://sam-randall.github.io/samrandall.github.io/docs/assets/sam_profile_pic.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" width="150"/>

I bridge the software engineering, data science and mathematical spaces to solve complex problems. I build **real-time ML applications**, **graph visualizations**, **iOS apps**, and **data dashboards**. I am also an applied mathematical researcher interested in applications of geometry, topology, deformation theory into various domains (e.g. machine learning, optimization).


#### Target Industries
- Smart Cities / Homes / Grids
- Climate Technology (analyzing satellite data, modeling climate patterns)
- National Security
- Robotics
- Scientific Computing (Computational & Mathematical Physics, Computational & Mathematical Biology, Computational & Mathematical Chemistry)
- Supply Chain Optimization
- Financial Services (e.g fraud detection, financial forecasting, portfolio optimization)
- AI

#### Education

Stanford University, MS, Computational and Mathematical Engineering.

Johns Hopkins University, BS, Applied Mathematics and Public Health.

## Select Projects & Experiences

### ML / Software Integration

I custom-build iOS applications with complex hardware and sensor requirements. 

I train ML models and embed them on edge applications (e.g iOS). 

Work Example: See the iPad App I built for Athena Security in action.

### High Performance Computing
I also have a strong background in High Performance Computing (C++, cuda, boost, OpenMP). I've built a physics simulator of a mesh with over 100k nodes as part of a Stanford course in Advanced Software Development. Here's a subset of the code I worked on: <a href="https://github.com/sam-randall/portfolio/blob/main/mesh_graph/Graph.hpp" target="_blank"> Mesh Graph Portfolio.</a>

Additionally, in CUDA and OpenMP, I implemented a multi-machine training algorithm for MNIST in CME 213, a Parallel Computing course at Stanford.

### System Modeling
At PHICOR, I worked to model, understand & quantify how epidemics (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30544164/" target="_blank">Zika</a>,
    <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31104883/" target="_blank">Chagas</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379721000210" target = "blank_">COVID</a>) impact a population. We used SIR and Markov models.

At the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/natural-sciences/about/directory/nathaniel-whitaker" target="_blank"> Whitaker</a> lab in UMASS Amherst, I modeled the dynamics and interactions of leukemia and healthy cells within a 1D vein using partial differential equations.

### Data Processing / Analysis
Scrape, organize, clean and analyze data for your needs.

I scripted data analysis software while working at PHICOR to standardize processes and reduce manual work spent on formatting text and figures. 


## Applications of Interest

#### Real-Time ML / Tiny ML (on IoT) / Robotics
- I'm really interested in working on resource-constrained ML problems. 

#### AI Control
- Hoping to connect with teams who need tight control or explainability over their ML models.

#### Climate Tech & Policy
- Apply data-driven and algorithmic methods to sustainability and climate solutions.

## Research Interests
I am also interested in applying concepts from mathematics (geometry and topology) to invigorate innovations & research in other disciplines:
- Machine Learning (esp. computer vision)
- Computational Theory & algorithms
    - Encryption & Data Compression
    - Graph Flow Algorithms, Causal Modeling.
- Interested in exploring applications in Applied Physics & Computational Biology.
