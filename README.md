# Sam Randall Consulting
### I am an engineering consultant who has experience tackling complex challenges with software and machine learning.

I'm also very interested in mathematical problems (e.g optimization, combinatorics) and system modeling tasks (e.g simulation, graphical modeling, geometric modeling) given my strong interest in Applied Mathematics. I received my Masters from Stanford University in Mathematical and Computational Engineering and find the intersections of applied mathematics with software and ML to be fascinating.

My resume is linked <a href="https://sam-randall.github.io/samrandall.github.io/resume/ConsultantRandall_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>
